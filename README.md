Node Project - Express Typescript

# Installation

The easiest way to get a consistent development environment every time is to make use of the [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

Once you open up this project VS Code, run the **Dev Containers: Reopen Folder in Container...** command from the Command Palette **(F1)**

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Modify if required.

After that just install packages using npm.

```
npm ci install
```
